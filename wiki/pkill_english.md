# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) pkill Usage: Terminate processes by name

## Overview
The `pkill` command in the Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is used to terminate processes based on their names or other attributes. It allows users to kill processes without needing to look up their process IDs (PIDs), making it a convenient tool for managing running applications.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `pkill` command is as follows:

```bash
pkill [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-f`: Match against the full command line instead of just the process name.
- `-n`: Kill the newest process matching the criteria.
- `-o`: Kill the oldest process matching the criteria.
- `-signal`: Specify a signal to send to the process (e.g., `-9` for SIGKILL).
- `-u`: Specify the user whose processes to kill.

## Common Examples
Here are several practical examples of using `pkill`:

1. **Terminate a process by name:**
   ```bash
   pkill firefox
   ```
   This command will terminate all instances of the Firefox browser.

2. **Kill processes matching a pattern:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "python script.py"
   ```
   This command will kill all processes that have "python script.py" in their command line.

3. **Send a specific signal to a process:**
   ```bash
   pkill -9 apache2
   ```
   This command forcefully kills all instances of the Apache web server by sending the SIGKILL signal.

4. **Kill the newest instance of a process:**
   ```bash
   pkill -n ssh
   ```
   This command will terminate the most recently started SSH session.

5. **Kill processes by user:**
   ```bash
   pkill -u username
   ```
   This command will terminate all processes owned by the specified user.

## Tips
- Always be cautious when using `pkill`, as it can terminate multiple processes at once.
- Use the `-n` or `-o` options if you only want to kill the most recent or oldest instance of a process.
- Consider using `pgrep` first to preview which processes will be affected before executing `pkill`.
