# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) fg Usage equivalent in English: Bring a background job to the foreground

## Overview
The `fg` command in the Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is used to bring a background job to the foreground. This allows users to interact with the job directly in the terminal, making it easier to manage tasks that were previously running in the background.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `fg` command is as follows:

```bash
fg [job_spec]
```

Here, `job_spec` refers to the specific job you want to bring to the foreground. If no job specification is provided, `fg` will default to the most recently suspended job.

## Common Options
- `job_spec`: This can be a job number or a job name. It specifies which background job to bring to the foreground.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `fg` command:

1. **Bring the most recent background job to the foreground:**
   ```bash
   fg
   ```

2. **Bring a specific job to the foreground using its job number:**
   ```bash
   fg %1
   ```

3. **Bring a specific job to the foreground using its job name:**
   ```bash
   fg %my_script
   ```

4. **If you have multiple jobs and want to bring the second one to the foreground:**
   ```bash
   fg %2
   ```

## Tips
- Always check your background jobs using the `jobs` command before using `fg` to know which job you want to bring to the foreground.
- If you have multiple jobs, remember that you can specify them by their job number or name to avoid confusion.
- Use `Ctrl + Z` to suspend a running job and send it to the background before using `fg` to bring it back when needed.
