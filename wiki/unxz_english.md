# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) unxz Usage: Decompress .xz files

## Overview
The `unxz` command is used to decompress files that have been compressed using the XZ compression algorithm. It is a simple and efficient way to restore files to their original state after compression.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `unxz` command is as follows:

```bash
unxz [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-k`, `--keep`: Keep the original compressed file after decompression.
- `-f`, `--force`: Force overwrite of existing files without prompting.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Display detailed information about the decompression process.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `unxz` command:

1. **Decompress a single file**:
   ```bash
   unxz file.xz
   ```

2. **Decompress a file and keep the original**:
   ```bash
   unxz -k file.xz
   ```

3. **Force decompression, overwriting any existing files**:
   ```bash
   unxz -f file.xz
   ```

4. **Decompress multiple files at once**:
   ```bash
   unxz file1.xz file2.xz file3.xz
   ```

5. **Verbose output during decompression**:
   ```bash
   unxz -v file.xz
   ```

## Tips
- Always check the available disk space before decompressing large files to avoid running out of space.
- Use the `-k` option if you want to keep the original compressed file for backup purposes.
- If you are decompressing multiple files, consider using wildcards (e.g., `*.xz`) to simplify the command.
