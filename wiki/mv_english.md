# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) mv Usage equivalent in English: Move or rename files and directories

## Overview
The `mv` command in the Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is used to move files and directories from one location to another. It can also be used to rename files and directories.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `mv` command is as follows:

```
mv [options] [source] [destination]
```

## Common Options
- `-i`: Prompts before overwriting an existing file.
- `-u`: Moves files only when the source file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing.
- `-v`: Verbosely shows the files being moved.

## Common Examples
1. **Moving a file to a different directory:**
   ```bash
   mv file.txt /path/to/destination/
   ```

2. **Renaming a file:**
   ```bash
   mv oldname.txt newname.txt
   ```

3. **Moving multiple files to a directory:**
   ```bash
   mv file1.txt file2.txt /path/to/destination/
   ```

4. **Using the interactive option to avoid overwriting:**
   ```bash
   mv -i file.txt /path/to/destination/
   ```

5. **Moving a directory:**
   ```bash
   mv /path/to/source_directory /path/to/destination_directory/
   ```

## Tips
- Always use the `-i` option when moving files to avoid accidental overwrites.
- To check what will happen before executing the command, consider using the `-v` option for a verbose output.
- When moving files across different filesystems, ensure you have the necessary permissions in both the source and destination locations.
