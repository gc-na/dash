# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) exit usage: Terminate a shell session

## Overview
The `exit` command in the Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is used to terminate the current shell session. It allows users to exit from the shell and return to the previous shell or close the terminal window entirely. The command can also return an exit status, which can be useful for scripting and automation.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `exit` command is as follows:

```sh
exit [n]
```

Here, `n` is an optional argument that specifies the exit status. If no status is provided, the exit status of the last executed command is used.

## Common Options
- `n`: An optional numeric value that specifies the exit status. By convention, an exit status of `0` indicates success, while any non-zero value indicates an error.

## Common Examples

1. **Exiting the shell without a status:**
   ```sh
   exit
   ```

2. **Exiting the shell with a specific status:**
   ```sh
   exit 1
   ```

3. **Using exit in a script:**
   ```sh
   #!/bin/dash
   echo "Running script..."
   # Some commands here
   exit 0
   ```

4. **Exiting from a subshell:**
   ```sh
   (echo "Inside subshell"; exit 2)
   echo "Back to main shell"
   ```

## Tips
- Always check the exit status of commands in scripts to handle errors appropriately.
- Use `exit 0` to indicate successful completion of a script or command.
- Remember that exiting from a subshell will not affect the parent shell; it only terminates the subshell session.
