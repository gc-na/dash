# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) clear Usage equivalent in English: Clear the terminal screen

## Overview
The `clear` command is used in the Debian Almquist Shell (dash) to clear the terminal screen of all previous commands and outputs, providing a clean workspace for new commands. It helps improve readability and organization in the terminal.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `clear` command is as follows:

```bash
clear [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
While `clear` is straightforward and doesn't have many options, here are a couple of common ones:

- `-x`: This option clears the screen and also removes any scrollback buffer, ensuring that all previous output is completely erased.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of how to use the `clear` command:

1. **Basic Usage:**
   To simply clear the terminal screen, you can run:
   ```bash
   clear
   ```

2. **Clear with Scrollback Removal:**
   If you want to clear the screen and also remove the scrollback buffer, use:
   ```bash
   clear -x
   ```

3. **Using Clear in a Script:**
   You can include the `clear` command in a shell script to ensure the screen is cleared before displaying new information:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/dash
   clear
   echo "Welcome to the new session!"
   ```

## Tips
- Use `clear` frequently during long terminal sessions to keep your workspace organized.
- Combine `clear` with other commands in scripts to enhance user experience by providing a clean output.
- Remember that `clear` does not delete any files or data; it only affects the visual output in the terminal.
