# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) bunzip2 Usage: Decompress bzip2 files

## Overview
The `bunzip2` command is used to decompress files that have been compressed using the bzip2 compression algorithm. It is a straightforward utility that allows users to restore their original files from the compressed format, making it essential for managing compressed data.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `bunzip2` command is as follows:

```bash
bunzip2 [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-k`: Keep the original compressed file after decompression.
- `-f`: Force decompression, even if the output file already exists.
- `-v`: Verbose mode; displays the progress of the decompression process.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using `bunzip2`:

1. **Decompress a single file:**
   ```bash
   bunzip2 file.bz2
   ```
   This command will decompress `file.bz2` and remove the compressed file.

2. **Decompress a file and keep the original:**
   ```bash
   bunzip2 -k file.bz2
   ```
   This will decompress `file.bz2` while preserving the original compressed file.

3. **Force decompression of a file:**
   ```bash
   bunzip2 -f file.bz2
   ```
   If `file` already exists, this command will overwrite it with the decompressed content.

4. **Decompress multiple files:**
   ```bash
   bunzip2 file1.bz2 file2.bz2
   ```
   This command decompresses both `file1.bz2` and `file2.bz2`.

## Tips
- Always check the available disk space before decompressing large files to avoid running out of space.
- Use the `-v` option for verbose output if you want to monitor the progress of the decompression.
- Consider using the `-k` option if you want to keep the original compressed files for backup or future use.
