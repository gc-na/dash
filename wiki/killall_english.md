# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) killall Usage: Terminate processes by name

## Overview
The `killall` command is used to terminate processes by name in the Debian Almquist Shell (dash). It allows users to stop all instances of a specified program, making it a powerful tool for managing running applications.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `killall` command is as follows:

```bash
killall [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-u <user>`: Kill processes owned by the specified user.
- `-s <signal>`: Specify the signal to send to the processes (default is TERM).
- `-q`: Suppress error messages for processes that do not exist.
- `-I`: Ignore case when matching process names.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `killall` command:

1. **Terminate all instances of a program:**
   ```bash
   killall firefox
   ```
   This command will close all running instances of Firefox.

2. **Send a specific signal to a process:**
   ```bash
   killall -s SIGKILL myapp
   ```
   This will forcefully terminate all instances of `myapp`.

3. **Kill processes owned by a specific user:**
   ```bash
   killall -u username
   ```
   This command will terminate all processes owned by the user `username`.

4. **Ignore case when terminating processes:**
   ```bash
   killall -I gedit
   ```
   This will terminate all instances of `gedit`, regardless of case.

5. **Suppress error messages:**
   ```bash
   killall -q non_existing_process
   ```
   This command will not display an error message if `non_existing_process` is not running.

## Tips
- Always double-check the process name you are targeting to avoid accidentally terminating the wrong application.
- Use the `-q` option if you want to run scripts without cluttering the output with error messages.
- Consider using `pgrep` to find process IDs before using `killall`, especially if you are unsure about the running processes.
