# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) groups usage: List user groups

## Overview
The `groups` command in the Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is used to display the groups that a specified user belongs to. If no user is specified, it shows the groups for the current user. This command is useful for managing user permissions and understanding user roles within the system.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `groups` command is as follows:

```bash
groups [options] [username]
```

## Common Options
- `-h`, `--help`: Display help information about the command.
- `-V`, `--version`: Show the version of the `groups` command.

## Common Examples

1. **Display groups for the current user:**
   ```bash
   groups
   ```

2. **Display groups for a specific user:**
   ```bash
   groups username
   ```

3. **Display help information:**
   ```bash
   groups --help
   ```

4. **Check the version of the groups command:**
   ```bash
   groups --version
   ```

## Tips
- Use the `groups` command to quickly verify user permissions and group memberships, especially when troubleshooting access issues.
- Remember that group memberships can affect the ability to access files and directories, so it's important to check them regularly.
- If you frequently check groups for multiple users, consider creating a simple script to automate the process.
