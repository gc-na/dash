# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) wait Usage: Wait for process completion

## Overview
The `wait` command in the Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is used to pause the execution of a script until a specified background process has completed. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure that a certain task has finished before proceeding with subsequent commands.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `wait` command is as follows:

```sh
wait [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `PID`: If a process ID (PID) is provided, `wait` will wait for that specific process to complete. If no PID is specified, `wait` will wait for all background processes to finish.

## Common Examples

### Example 1: Wait for a specific background process
```sh
sleep 5 &  # Start a background process
pid=$!     # Capture the PID of the last background process
wait $pid  # Wait for that specific process to complete
echo "Process $pid has finished."
```

### Example 2: Wait for all background processes
```sh
sleep 3 &  # Start a background process
sleep 4 &  # Start another background process
wait       # Wait for all background processes to complete
echo "All background processes have finished."
```

### Example 3: Using wait in a script
```sh
#!/bin/dash
echo "Starting tasks..."
task1() { sleep 2; echo "Task 1 done"; }
task2() { sleep 3; echo "Task 2 done"; }

task1 &  # Start task1 in the background
task2 &  # Start task2 in the background
wait     # Wait for both tasks to finish
echo "All tasks completed."
```

## Tips
- Always capture the PID of a background process if you need to wait for it specifically.
- Use `wait` in scripts to ensure that dependent tasks do not start until their prerequisites have finished.
- Be cautious when using `wait` without arguments, as it will block until all background processes are complete, which may not always be desired.
