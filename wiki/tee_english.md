# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) tee Usage: Redirect output to files and display it

## Overview
The `tee` command in the Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is used to read from standard input and write to standard output and files simultaneously. This allows users to view output on the terminal while also saving it to one or more files.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `tee` command is as follows:

```bash
tee [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-a`, `--append`: Append the output to the specified files instead of overwriting them.
- `-i`, `--ignore-interrupts`: Ignore interrupt signals.
- `--help`: Display help information about the command.
- `--version`: Show the version of the `tee` command.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `tee` command:

1. **Basic Usage**: Redirect output of a command to a file while displaying it.
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, World!" | tee output.txt
   ```

2. **Appending to a File**: Append output to an existing file.
   ```bash
   echo "Another line" | tee -a output.txt
   ```

3. **Using with Multiple Files**: Write output to multiple files at once.
   ```bash
   echo "Logging output" | tee file1.txt file2.txt
   ```

4. **Combining with Other Commands**: Use `tee` in a pipeline.
   ```bash
   ls -l | tee directory_list.txt | grep ".txt"
   ```

## Tips
- Use the `-a` option when you want to keep existing data in a file and add new data to it.
- Consider using `tee` in scripts where you want to log output while still monitoring it in real-time.
- Be cautious when using `tee` with commands that produce a lot of output, as it can create large files quickly.
