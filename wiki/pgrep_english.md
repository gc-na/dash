# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) pgrep Usage: Find process IDs by name

## Overview
The `pgrep` command in the Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is used to search for processes currently running on the system based on their names or other attributes. It returns the process IDs (PIDs) of the matching processes, making it a useful tool for managing and monitoring system processes.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `pgrep` command is as follows:

```bash
pgrep [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-u USER`: Search for processes owned by the specified user.
- `-f`: Match against the full command line instead of just the process name.
- `-n`: Only return the newest (most recently started) process.
- `-o`: Only return the oldest (least recently started) process.
- `-l`: List the process names along with their PIDs.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `pgrep` command:

1. **Find the PID of a specific process by name:**
   ```bash
   pgrep bash
   ```

2. **Find PIDs of processes owned by a specific user:**
   ```bash
   pgrep -u username
   ```

3. **Match against the full command line:**
   ```bash
   pgrep -f "python script.py"
   ```

4. **Get the newest instance of a process:**
   ```bash
   pgrep -n ssh
   ```

5. **List PIDs along with process names:**
   ```bash
   pgrep -l httpd
   ```

## Tips
- Use `pgrep` in combination with other commands like `kill` to terminate processes by their names.
- For scripts, consider using `pgrep` with the `-f` option to ensure you are matching the correct command line.
- When searching for processes, be mindful of case sensitivity; `pgrep` is case-sensitive by default. Use the `-i` option for case-insensitive matching.
