# [English] Debian Almquist Shell (dash) tail Usage: Display the end of files

## Overview
The `tail` command in the Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is used to display the last part of files. It is particularly useful for viewing the most recent entries in log files or any other text files, allowing users to monitor updates in real-time.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `tail` command is as follows:

```bash
tail [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-n <number>`: Specify the number of lines to display from the end of the file. For example, `-n 10` shows the last 10 lines.
- `-f`: Follow the file as it grows, displaying new lines as they are added. This is especially useful for monitoring log files.
- `-c <number>`: Display the last specified number of bytes instead of lines.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `tail` command:

1. Display the last 10 lines of a file:
   ```bash
   tail myfile.txt
   ```

2. Display the last 20 lines of a file:
   ```bash
   tail -n 20 myfile.txt
   ```

3. Follow a log file in real-time:
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/syslog
   ```

4. Display the last 50 bytes of a file:
   ```bash
   tail -c 50 myfile.txt
   ```

5. Combine following and specifying lines:
   ```bash
   tail -n 5 -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
   ```

## Tips
- Use `tail -f` when you want to monitor log files for real-time updates; it will keep the terminal open and display new entries as they are added.
- Combine `tail` with other commands using pipes to filter or process the output further.
- If you need to check multiple files, you can specify them all in one command: `tail file1.txt file2.txt`.
